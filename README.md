# Tanley-Wood-Project2



In the README.md file you should create links to each of the documents you will create
(Lifestyle analysis, Entertainment analysis, etc.). Links can be made to the sub-documents using relative
paths. For instance, if you have all of the outputted .md files in the main directory you would just use
markdown linking:
• The analysis for [Lifestyle articles is available here](LifestyleAnalysis.html). Note we
link to the html file even though the file we create is a .md file - github creates the .html for us.
In the repo’s README.md file (which doesn’t need to be created from a .Rmd file, just use the one you initialize
into the repo if you want) give a brief description of the purpose of the repo, a list of R packages used, links
to the generated analyses, and the code used to create the analyses from a single .Rmd file (i.e. the render()
code).
