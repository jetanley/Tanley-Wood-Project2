# ST558 Project 2
By Jordan Tanley and Jonathan Wood

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to store the necessary files for the ST558 Project 2 and to create a space for collaboration between assigned partners, Jonathan and Jordan. The focus of this project is to investigate shares for news sites using the [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  

## Required R Packages

The repqired packages include:

* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): This package loads in several packages, 3 of which we will use:  
  - [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/): Used to read in the data  
  - [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): Used for plotting and making figures
  - [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): Coding grammar
* [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/): This allows us to use `kable` for producing nice tables  
* [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/): Used for building our models
